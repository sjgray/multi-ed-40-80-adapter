PET/CBM Multi-EditROM with 40/80 column switcher Adapter
========================================================

This adapter lets your PET/CBM computer with Universal Dynamic PET motherboard
to have up to 16 Edit ROM available and selectable via DIP Switch or Toggle Switch.
and adds the ability for the video to be switched between 40 or 80 columns either
via software, or toggle switch (selectable).

Use my Multi-EDIT-ROM-Builder program (also available on github) to combine
up to 16 editor roms into a single 64K EPROM.

Use my PET/CBM EditROM Project to create custom Editor ROMs with various features
including software-switchable 40/80 column support via this board.
